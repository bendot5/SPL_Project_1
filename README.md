# Project 1: C++ Memory Management & Simulation (Heap & Stack)

## Overview

This project is a C++ simulation of a settlement construction system, focusing on memory management using heap and stack allocation. The simulation models various settlements, construction plans, and policies that determine how facilities are built over time.

## Key Features

- **Memory Management**: Utilized stack and heap allocation effectively, ensuring optimized memory usage.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implemented settlements, plans, and facility construction policies using OOP principles.
- **Simulation Execution**: Managed step-by-step construction progress with efficient data structures.
- **Smart Pointers & Manual Allocation**: Prevented memory leaks while optimizing performance.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- STL Containers (Vectors, Maps, etc.)

## Installation & Usage
